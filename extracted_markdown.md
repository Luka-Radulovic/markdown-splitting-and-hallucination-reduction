Abstract

Epidemiological studies indicate that the consumption of caffeine, the most commonly ingested psychoactive substance

found in coffee, tea or soft drinks, reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previous treatment studies

with transgenic AD mouse models reported a reduced amyloid plaque load and an amelioration of behavioral deficits. It has

been further shown that moderate doses of caffeine have the potential to attenuate the health burden in preclinical mouse

models of a variety of brain disorders (reviewed in Cunha in J Neurochem 139:1019–1055, 2016). In the current study, we

assessed whether long-term caffeine consumption affected hippocampal neuron loss and associated behavioral deficits in

the Tg4-42 mouse model of AD. Treatment over a 4-month period reduced hippocampal neuron loss, rescued learning and

memory deficits, and ameliorated impaired neurogenesis. Neuron-specific RNA sequencing analysis in the hippocampus

revealed an altered expression profile distinguished by the up-regulation of genes linked to synaptic function and processes,

and to neural progenitor proliferation. Treatment of 5xFAD mice, which develop prominent amyloid pathology, with the

same paradigm also rescued behavioral deficits but did not affect extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) levels or amyloid precursor

protein (APP) processing. These findings challenge previous assumptions that caffeine is anti-amyloidogenic and indicate

that the promotion of neurogenesis might play a role in its beneficial effects.
